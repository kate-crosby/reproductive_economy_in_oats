Reproductive Economy In Oats
============================

Little R simulation I wrote for paper back for annual plants under two life-history size strategies with competition in 2012 (Crosby and Latta 2013, Evolutionary Ecology, doi:10.1007/s10682-012-9573-3) when all I could do was "for" loops in R. This is pretty brute force script. I'm sure it could be prettier.
